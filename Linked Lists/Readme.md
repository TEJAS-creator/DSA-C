### 1. Singly Linked List
| Operation              | Description                       | Time Complexity |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| Insert at Beginning    | Add node at the head              | O(1)             |
| Insert at End          | Add node at the tail              | O(n)             |
| Insert at Position     | Add node at specific index        | O(n)             |
| Delete from Beginning  | Remove head node                  | O(1)             |
| Delete from End        | Remove tail node                  | O(n)             |
| Delete at Position     | Remove node at index              | O(n)             |
| Traverse / Display     | Print all nodes                   | O(n)             |
